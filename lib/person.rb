# Think of a class like the blueprint that defines how to build an object.
# The Dog class is different from an individual dog just as the blueprints that show how to build a house are not the actual house.
# A Ruby class both contains the instructions for creating new objects and has the ability to create those objects.
# Calling .new on the Dog class is like getting a brand new dog object from an assembly line
# which produces a series of similar dog objects based on the same Dog template.
